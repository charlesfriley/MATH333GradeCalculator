     * the object[][] would look something like:
     *  {"Final Grade", "Quiz Weight", "Test Weight", "Final Weight", "Resulting Grade"},
     *  {"Final Grade2", "Quiz Weight2", "Test Weight2", "Final Weight2", "Resulting Grade2"},
     *  ...

     * // basicly this file needs to request a calculation from calculator.java at a certain final, quiz, and test grade. 
     * // then it will request another, and another, and another
     * // it will orginize all this code into a Object[][] that the table in DisplayResults.java can use.
     * 
     * // ALSO THIS FILE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ORGINIZE THIS FOR TERMINAL USE ONLY so that people can use it on online web compilers.
