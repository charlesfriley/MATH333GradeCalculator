public class Calculator {
    
/*
 * TODO
 * must calculate the stuff
 * must return an Object[][]
 * This class should take in the user quiz grade and user test grade, then calculate all the
 * best grades for if the final grade is 5%, 10%, 15%... 95%, 100%. the object[][] would look something like:
 *  {"Final Grade", "Quiz Weight", "Test Weight", "Final Weight", "Resulting Grade"},
 *  {"Final Grade2", "Quiz Weight2", "Test Weight2", "Final Weight2", "Resulting Grade2"},
 *  ...
 * 
 * Here is how i think this file will work: You will request a single line of information for the chart 
 *  so this file needs 3 inputs, your final grade, quiz grade, and test grade
 *  it will output an array of objects to be put into the final object[][] that the data table uses
 *
